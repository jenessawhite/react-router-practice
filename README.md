This project was created by [Jenessa White](@jenessawhite) and is practice for creating a website with multiple pages, using react-router. One of the pages is a list of Best Buy stores with their information and a Google Map showing where they are located. It also includes a homepage, navigation bar, and an about page as well.

## Sources

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The API for this project was provided by [The Best Buy API Playground](https://github.com/bestbuy/api-playground), which is provided by Best Buy as a learning tool for developers. This app is an educational project and is not created or endorsed by Best Buy. This project also utilizes [React-Google-Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps).
